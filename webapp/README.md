# Energy Usage Web Application


## Overview

Web application displaying the energy usage and meter readings of a user.


## Task

### Overview

The goal of this task is to improve the application. We leave it up to you define what this means (refactor the code, improve the style, add tests, etc...).

With this task we aim to get a feel of your coding practices and style.

### Notes

* The application displays static meter readings stored in the [data folder](./src/data/meterReadingsSample.js). If you have time, you can have a look at the webapi project and fetch data from this API.
* We don't expect you to spend any time changing the logic to calculate the energy usage. This is what the other exercise is about.
* We use a library called [recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/) to display charts. We don't expect you to become an expert by any means.

## Setup

### Dependencies

The main dependencies are listed below. Feel free to change any of these (apart from React), e.g. use a different bundler, test libraries or local server.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) as web framework
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for testing
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as bundler
* [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) as a local dev server
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) as transpiler
* [recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/) for charts

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to manage dependencies.
